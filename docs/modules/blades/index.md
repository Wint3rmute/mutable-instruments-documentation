## Features

### An essential overdrive circuit

* A CV-controlled overdrive stage precedes each of the two filters.
* Overdrive response continuously adjustable between soft-clipping and 2-stage wavefolding.

### Two rich multimode filters

* Clean 2-pole (12dB/octave) state-variable design.
* CV-controlled filter response, continuously variable between low-pass, band-pass and high-pass.
* CV inputs with attenuverters for cutoff and resonance.
* Unattenuated frequency CV input, calibrated for 1V/Oct tracking.
* Clean self-oscillation across the audio range, extending into very low frequencies, with constant amplitude.
* Modulating the filter response is akin to modulating the phase of the self-oscillation tone.

### Unique routing possibilities

* Continuously variable (and CV-controlled) routing from single to parallel to series.
* With a signal patched into filter 2's audio input, the routing knob and CV act as a crossfader.
* Filter 2's cutoff can be set relatively to filter 1's cutoff.

### Specifications

* Fully analog, based on the V2164 quad VCA chip.
* Frequency knob range: 8Hz to 18kHz.
* Audio input impedance: 30k.
* DC-coupled audio inputs.
* Filter mode CV input impedance: 50k.
* Other CV inputs impedance: 100k.
* All CV inputs handle audio-rate modulations.
