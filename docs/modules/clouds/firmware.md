## Revisions

### v1.31

Fixed a bug causing the **BLEND** knob to temporarily match a previously saved value instead of immediately tracking changes when the module is powered on.

### v1.3

Changed the response curve of the **DRY/WET** setting to an equal power curve.

### v1.2

Delayed the processing of triggers received on the **TRIG** input by 1 ms. This change allows Clouds to work better with CV sources with slow settling times.

### v1.1

Initial release.
