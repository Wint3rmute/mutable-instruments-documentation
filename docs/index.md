This site is a comprehensive archive of Mutable Instruments modules' documentation.

Each section follows the same template:

- **Index** contains the main specifications of the module, and a link to the original printed manual.
- **Firmware** contains firmware update files and version history.
- **Manual** is the comprehensive online manual.
- **Original blurb** is an archive of the "marketing" text used to highlight the features of the module.
- **Open source** contains links to the github repository, and to the schematics. If the module is digital, additional resources for firmware development are provided.
